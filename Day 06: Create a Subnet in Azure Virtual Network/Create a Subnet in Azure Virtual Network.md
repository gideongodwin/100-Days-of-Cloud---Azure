## Day 6: Create a Subnet in Azure Virtual Network

#### Task Details:
The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition.
- Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named `devops-vnet` and one subnet named `devops-subnet` within the VNet in the `East US` region. Make sure the IPv4 address range is `10.0.0.0/16`

#### STEPS:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2. Use the global search bar to search for “Virtual network.” From the results, select “Virtual network.”
